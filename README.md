==============================

The NBA draft is an annual event in which teams select players from their American colleges as well as international professional leagues to join their rosters. Moving to the NBA league is a big deal for any basketball player. 

Sport commentators and fans are very excited to follow the careers of college players and guess who will be drafted by an NBA team.

This assigment build a model that will predict if a college basketball player will be drafted to join the NBA league based on his statistics for the current season.
